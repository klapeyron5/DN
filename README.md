CV algorithm which predicts the angle of car number on the photo. The car number must have angle variance [-15,15] from the horizon and occupy a significant place on the photo (minimum is around 0.25 of the image area). Negative angle means clockwise rotation.

The scripts get a path of an image in standard input and return the angle in degrees into standard output.
